I'm Sandy, your new assistant. I'll remember the details so you can focus on what's important.

  -  Kick off your morning knowing what's on for the day.
  -  Keep your day moving forward with reminders right when you need them.
  -  Books to read, people to call, your cousin's birthday --  I'll remember it all.
  -  Stay organized with everyone in your life -- effortlessly.

Squeeze more productivity out of your current system.

I'm not here to yank you out of the organizing system you already know and love (or hate). I'll help you use your system better. It doesn't matter if you're a BlackBerry addict, an Outlook devotee, a paper calendar user, or your to-do list is recorded on the backs of receipts. 

Don’t sweat (or forget) the small stuff.

Some details are too small or short-term to make it into your organizing system. But that doesn't make them any less important. Let me remember those ephemeral tasks that are the easiest to forget.

I'll remind you to feed the meter, take your vitamins, or put your wet laundry in the dryer.
